      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Billed as a conference for designers and developers, An Event Apart was recently in San Francisco, featuring educational and inspiring talks from various leaders in their respective fields.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">

         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/zeldman.png" class="circle-image" alt="" style="width: 160px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 50%;"/>
         <p> 
            <strong>Jeffrey Zeldman</strong>, father of web standards and co-founder of this event, reminds us t​​hat we’re all in the business of impressions. He readily admits how often he’s been fired from various jobs — often. He was that guy who cared ... REALLY cared about the end product. Unfortunately, what came with that mindset, was often disdain for folks with a different approach to the work. He was viewed as confrontational. A complainer. Not a “team player.” And he was instantly branded. Zeldman found this out, and instantly began t​o turn around his image. Months later ... he was fired anyway. When he asked about it, his boss told him that “quite frankly, you’re still that same guy — just faking it right now. I want someone who truly wants to be here.”</p>
         <p>Customers can often be the same way about first impressions. So be careful about how you release that MVP to your audience. Many users don&#39;t come back later, after catching that first whiff of a potentially-half-baked product.</p>

            <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">webpagetest.org</a> does, one of the coolest might be how it  creates video comparisons of loading times. It&#39;s a great way to compare two sites, or even two versions (A/B test) of a site in progress. (you might need to hit play twice in&#160;this example)<br/></p>

         <p>According to 
            <strong>Yesenia Perez-Cruz[JOB TITLE?]</strong>, there&#39;s simply not enough communication along the way to honestly assess performance issues. Fast sites are memorable. Fast sites also build trust. Cruz points out that 
            <strong>performance</strong> should be a project goal, right from the start — having a place at the table with development, design and project management.</p>
         <p>Taking it a step further, each project should have some sort of&#160;<strong><a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/how-to-make-a-performance-budget/">performance budget</a></strong>. These often include things like &quot;Page A shouldn&#39;t take more than XX seconds to load over a XX connection.&quot; Find similar sites to your project, possibly even competitors. Look at their results on webpagetest.org, and go for a 20% speed increase (the number where users perceive a noticable difference). </p>

         <p>Once you have documented numbers in place, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s much easier to argue for (or against) that new feature ... especially if you can&#39;t find a way to keep it within your budget.</p>

         <p class="aea-caption" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 40px !important;">We&#39;re a bit of an odd duck when it comes to apps. Especially when compared to our friends across the pond.</p>
         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/moll.png" class="circle-image" alt="" style="width: 160px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 50%;"/>
         <p>While known more for his best-selling book, 
            <em>CSS Mastery</em>, 
            <strong>Cameron Moll</strong> encouraged us to really listen to our users. One of the first questions might be, do we even know what they think about our product? Pay attention to product feedback and app reviews, and watch user actions. According to a recent study by Google, &quot;49% of multi-screen users 
            <strong>email themselves a link</strong> for continuing an activity on another device.&quot; If that&#39;s the case, why don&#39;t we incorporate an &quot;Email to Self&quot; button on 
            <em>all</em> our apps, and make things easier for our customers?</p>
         <p>Many users are vocal about wanting experiences to work across all their devices, which isn&#39;t exactly news. But Moll feels we have room to grow in this area. He gives a common example of starting, say, a shopping experience on your phone before you leave work. Yet when you log in to your desktop version at home, that site has no recollection of the activities you&#39;d already started. Facebook reports that &quot;More than 40 percent of all online U.S. users start an activity on one device and finish on another.&quot; Is that an area where we can improve? </p>

         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/amazon.jpg" class="aea-image" alt=""/>
         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/hogan.png" class="circle-image" alt="" style="width: 160px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 50%;"/>

            <strong><br/>Lara Hogan </strong>is the Senior Engineering Manager of Performance at Etsy and the author of 
            <em>Designing for Performance</em>. Her discussion keyed around all the various things Etsy has done to make their site faster — things everyone can do. Her main message? Test, test, test. Hogan began seeing a wealth of data around her, making it much easier to make smarter decisions. In one example, when Etsy 
            <strong><em>added a mere 160k to a page, they saw a 12% increase in bounce rate on mobile.</em></strong></p>
         <p>Here&#39;s a quick roundup of bullet points from Hogan for slimming down your site:</p>
         <ul>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Reduce your number of requests: Why use multiple CSS files when one will do? Would one sprite do a better performance job that ten separate images? How many scripts are you calling in?</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">On average, images take up more than 70% of the total bytes per page. That&#39;s a strong shout out for the use of responsive images (we do this with One Nation, as an example). Not only can you significantly reduce file size without much quality loss (see below), but you can also call in an image that best fits the screen size.<br/><br/></li>
         </ul>
         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/quality.jpg" class="aea-image" alt=""/> 
         <ul>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">With fonts, keep in mind that earlier versions of Internet Explorer downloads all @font-face files, even if they aren&#39;t used. Only import the font weights you absolutely need.</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Webfonts are fine, but use them sparingly. Labels and headlines work well, but don&#39;t use them for body copy, unless you want your site to  slow down.</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Make performance part of everyone&#39;s workflow.</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Always use a mobile-first workflow. So with CSS media queries, make your top, main CSS keyed to those small devices. As you work your way down the code, introduce queries for larger and larger screen sizes.</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Use A/B tests to measure aesthetics vs. performance impact.</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;">Celebrate victories on performance wins (example below).<br/><br/> </li>
         </ul>

            <br/>With clients that include CERN, the W3C, Google, Apress, and The New York Stock Exchange, 
            <strong>Jen Simmons</strong> has the experience to back up her words. We ... are in a rut. Many things caused this dip in design quality: inefficient code, poor tools, slow bandwidth, speed to market, etc. Once, there was a day when design pulled in the viewers, capturing their imagination as well as their eyeballs. We called it ... &quot;print design.&quot;  </p>
         <p>Look around you. The web mainly comes in two flavors these days. There&#39;s the 
            <strong>header/body/sidebar/footer</strong> method (right), and the stacked, one column approach. Fortunately, more tools are here (or coming soon) that will help us change the way we design 
            <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/template.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;"/>our pages. But Simmons rightly points out that while we have a strong history of deliberate, thoughtful print design ... our web layout structure looks like an afterthought.</p>
         <p>Today, we have the power of CSS transform ... and with that means the ability to rotate, skew, scale, transform and show perspective.  We can set images as cover elements to fill the browser window, and do a lot of interesting transitions and animations, WITHOUT the use of Flash! In addition, we can also set type into columns, opening up even more possibilities (below).<br/><br/></p>
         <img src="http://devwww.azcentral.com/LDSN/event-apart/columns.jpg" class="aea-image" alt=""/>
         <p>There were many examples shown, and we can&#39;t go that deep in this post. In the end, her message was simple: Don&#39;t settle for good enough. The web is on the cusp of a design revolution, one that the print world has enjoyed for many years. With the addition of CSS Grids in 2016, the right tools might (finally) be in place. </p>

            <strong><br/>Jeremy Keith</strong>, author of 
            <em>Bulletproof Ajax</em> and 
            <em>DOM Scripting</em>, encourages us all to remember the foundations that make the Web so great. When Tim Berners-Lee wrote his &quot;proposal&quot; in 1989 about a &quot;distributed hypertext system,&quot; he unknowingly set up a structure so solid, that it would still work 25+ years later. </p>
         <p>There are many ways to get content onto our webpages. Some  are 
            <strong>fragile</strong>, while others are 
            <strong>resilient</strong>. Javascript, for example, is fragile. If something goes wrong in your JS code, the script instantly stops, throws an error ... and your page stops loading. There&#39;s very little forgiveness there, if any at all. On the other hand, HTML is considered resilient. It was built to 
            <strong>not</strong> throw errors. You can actually introduce your own tags, even use improper tags. Even so, the content still gets delivered. You might lose your styling, but hey, the page still renders.</p>
         <p>Keith recommends starting projects with the following three-step approach:</p>
         <ol>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;"> 
               <strong>Identify core functionality</strong></li>
            <ul>
               <li>Is it a news app? Make sure you can read the news, no matter what.</li>
               <li>Is it a messaging app? Make sure you can send and receive messages, no matter what.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;"> 
               <strong>Make that functionality available using the simplest technology</strong></li>
            <ul>
               <li>News app articles: HTML</li>
               <li>Sending messages: HTML forms</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="listitem" style="margin-top: 10px;"> 
               <strong>Enhance!</strong></li>
            <ul>
               <li>News app articles: Layut with CSS and media queries. Webfonts with font-face.</li>
               <li>Sending messages: AJAX keep from doing a full page refresh; websockets to receive messages without a refrsh.</li>
            </ul>
         </ol>
         <p>With this approach, you can do simple, AND immersive. The base functionality ensures that everyone has access — and then has enhancements added where useful. Be beware of the fragility of Javascript. Remember, if a browser doesn’t understand a HTML tag, that’s OK, it just ignores that tag. It doesn’t throw an error. Just make sure there’s a child tag that makes sure it still works good enough.</p>
         <p>The author closed by saying that we tend to tell ourselves that same lie over and over. &quot;If everyone would just get off IE6, 7, 8.&quot;  &quot;If everyone would just move to 1024x768 monitors.&quot; &quot;If everone would just get on 3G connections.&quot; There&#39;s always that next thing where we hope things will be perfect, vs figuring out a way to delivery to everyone.</p>
         <p>Keep things simple. Use the things that don’t break, and don’t throw errors. Use technology that’s resilient. Consider how far HTML can take you.</p>

            <br/>Beacons are still a hot little dev tools these days (along with Arduino projects). The thing about beacons, according to 
            <strong>Josh Clark</strong>, is that they&#39;re still in their infancy. Recently, a company actually found a way to place a beacon inside a diaper, alerting parents when little Timmy had an oopsie — alerting the parents through an app.</p>
         <p>But most users certainly don&#39;t want what Tom Cruise was receiving in Minority Report. Beacons are often being used in a jerk kind of way, like users want 
            <strong>that</strong>. Clark encourages us to deliver information and get out of the way. Use the world as your inferface, and try to use your Bluetooth beacon for the good. He thinks a great example of this is

            <br/>When handed a responsive design project, one of the things handcuffing designers and developers is the ordering of items. &quot;We&#39;ll put the sidebar div and the ad after the body div, that way we can float the sidebar to the right on desktop, but it&#39;ll fall naturally beneath the body on a phone.&quot; Yes, 
            <strong>that</strong> kind of scintillating conversation.<strong> Rachel Andrew</strong> thinks those conversations might soon be a thing of the past. </p>

         <p>Designers have been searching for better and better ways to control the look of their content. We were happy to get rid of tables (then email newsletters came along). We became even happier when CSS was introduced. But even with CSS, designers still often deal with floats and hacks to try and accomplish the look and positioning they want.</p>

            <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2015/11/03/three-years-with-css-grid-layout/"><strong>CSS Grid Layouts</strong></a> appear to be the solution</p>
         <p>Andrew says, &quot;Since the early days of the web, designers have been trying to lay out web pages using grid systems. Likewise, almost every CSS framework attempts to implement some kind of grid system, using floats and often leaning on preprocessors. The CSS Grid Layout module brings us a native CSS Grid system for the first time — a grid system that does not rely on document source order, and can create complex layouts which are easily redefined with media queries.&quot;</p>
         <p>Content can be in any order in the HTML? Mind blown. Approval of this working draft can&#39;t happen quick enough.</p>
